The NEO-6M GPS module is a compact and cost-effective GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module manufactured by u-blox.
- The NEO-6M module is a complete GPS receiver that receives signals from GPS satellites to determine its precise location coordinates (latitude and longitude), altitude, speed, and time.
- The NEO-6M module communicates with external microcontrollers or devices via a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) serial interface. It typically operates at standard baud rates such as 9600 or 115200 bps.


LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Specification: Detects light intensity with resistance varying inversely with the amount of light.
Feature: Simple and cost-effective light sensing component.
Use: Commonly used in automatic lighting systems to detect daylight.
Sensitivity: Typically responsive to visible light spectrum.
Resistance Range: Varies from a few hundred ohms (in light) to several megaohms (in darkness).


Arduino
Specification: Open-source microcontroller platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
Feature: Supports various digital and analog I/O pins for connecting different sensors and actuators.
Use: Acts as the central processing unit for collecting data from sensors and controlling actuators.
Programming: Coded using Arduino IDE with a simplified version of C++.
Models: Available in different models (e.g., Uno, Mega) with varying capabilities.



ZMPT Voltage Sensor
Specification: Measures AC voltage up to 250V with high accuracy.
Feature: Includes a high-precision voltage transformer and signal conditioning circuitry.
Use: Ideal for monitoring and measuring AC mains voltage in real-time.
Accuracy: Provides a stable and accurate voltage measurement, suitable for fault detection.
Output: Analog signal proportional to the measured voltage for easy interfacing with microcontrollers.


SCT Current Sensor (e.g., SCT-013)
Specification: Non-invasive AC current sensor with a typical measurement range of 0-100A.
Feature: Clip-on design allows easy installation without disrupting the circuit.
Use: Measures the current passing through a conductor for load monitoring and fault detection.
Output: Provides an analog output signal proportional to the current flow.
Safety: Isolated measurement ensures safety when monitoring high voltage lines
