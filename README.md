This is the android application for our street light fault detection and location tracking, as apps are on handheld devices, it gets really easy for municipal maintenance workers or technicians to track and locate the street lights.
The user first needs to do the registration and then its login, and for login purpose I need to just enter the name, and password and then we will land on our main activity wherein we get two option i.e. maps and graph
now after we check map so here firstly I have used google maps for geolocation services, wherein I used there dynamic maps api, and also I took two markers two display the bulbs exact location, 
this app integrates Firebase for real-time data synchronization due to which after clicking on each bulb we get its status and also its power value, 
after we check the graphs now here along with my other group member have integrated the  ThingSpeak for data visualization, so it displays the dynamic charts from ThingSpeak.
